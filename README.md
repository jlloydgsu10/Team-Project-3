# Oil Price â€“ A Comprehensive Outlook

## Project Summary: 

### In the aftermath of the global covid pandemic, the hike in oil & gas prices motivated us to assess not only the effects of rising oil price to our economy but to search for some of the key drivers that address oil price fluctuations. Given the fact that some of the major world events revolve around "OIL" the data digs deeper into only the factuals, like supply/demand rather than the geo-political problems surrounding this topic which drive the oil price.

### Some of the major effects to the US society viz: Inflation, unemployment, gas prices and presidential approval rating, are addressed herein.

### One of the findings was that US being the biggest consumer of oil, it is one of the largest producers of oil even though it ranks 11 in reserves estimation. To understand US oil and gas product, the data further delves into comparing the US unconventional basins, their production and rig count for the last decade.

## Instructions:
- Download the repo to local machine
- Scripts included in the repo: python, SQL, python-flask, sqlalchemy, jupyter notebook, leaflet.js, d3.js, plotly.js
- Signup for an API key with EIA.gov and save it in config.py to use for running the notebooks: Production_Data-forjs.ipynb & US_BasinProd_Data-sql.ipynb
    <https://www.eia.gov>
- Run all jupyter notebook files in the "code" folder and "Jupyter_notebook_flask" folder to update sql database and make necessary csv's for plotly.js
- Run app2.py for generating the graphs for comparison. 
- Run basin.html separately for US shale oil basin visualization on separate webpage. 

## Future work: 
- To populate all the graphs using the flask-powered api
- Add a choropleth to US basin map for rigcount and oil production separately.
